Being an authority blogger needs effort and experience that are built over years of time, but being a guest blogger is a way ahead of it. Not just the writing part, here a blogger does need to have a comprehensive knowledge of the niche and the reputation of the site for which he is blogging. The guest bloggers need to build a good traffic for the blog owners, this way they succeed in establishing a healthy relation with the owner as well as the readers. For achieving the same, you need a full-proof strategy, and while working on those strategies do not forget to leverage these facts:

•    Working in a specific niche is beneficial
Guest blogging does not mean that you have to write just by the guidelines of the blog owner. In fact, it is suggested that first write a blog and then pitch for it, on a related blog. This way, you maintain your ethics and writing style while benefiting the blog owner. It is not necessary that a travel blogger have to follow the guidelines of a food blog just for the sake of backlinks. Rather, stick to your niche and try to find the relevant blogs for which you can pitch. 

•    Quantity Never Counts Over Quality
A 500-word blog is enough to fall in the eyes of Google. However, every word of this 500 quantity should be effective and meaningful. In the instant surge of traffic, bloggers tend to increase the quantity of the blogs. Nevertheless, they have to understand that guest blogging does not come up with an instant effect; rather you will see the benefits over a certain period. Instead of being impatient, be consistent with the quality and quantity of the posts.
